## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

This was more of a re-enforcement of knowledge already acquired, because I had already built a similar project sometime back. So it was ore of a refresher course, kinda.

### Continued development

I'd like to improve on my knowledge base of arrays and how they work, and a much more solid understanding of functions because I encountered some unexpected errors along the way
